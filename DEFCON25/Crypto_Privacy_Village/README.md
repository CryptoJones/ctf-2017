# Crypto and Privacy Village
## The Gold Bug Returns

At this years DEF CON, the Crypto and Privacy Village held a small competition, with several different crypto-related riddles. We ended up 4th, which we are pretty happy about.

The team had originally told each other not to partake in any challenges. As this was our first time at DEF CON,
 we didn't want to end up spending all of our time solving riddles and challenges. However, we just HAD to try a little bit.
Turns out, this year the first place winners got a black badge, so maybe we will try harder next year?

The website is still up at [http://goldbug.cryptovillage.org/tgbr/](http://goldbug.cryptovillage.org/tgbr/). And the challenges are:

- iOS
- ColecoVision
- ZX Spectrum
- Atari 2600
- Nintendo 64
- Apple II
- Game Boy
- META challenge

Some of these were handed out on paper as well, and some were not. We only managed to solve 5 of them, namely:

- [iOS](./iOS/iOS.md)
- [ColecoVision](./ColecoVision/ColecoVision.md)
- [ZX Spectrum](./ZXSpectrum/ZXSpectrum.md)
- [Playstation 2]()
- [Apple II](./AppleII/AppleII.md)
